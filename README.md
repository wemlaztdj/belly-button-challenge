# belly-button-challenge
## Background
In this assignment, an interactive dashboard is created to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset (https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity), which catalogs the microbes colonizing human navels. The dataset discloses that a small handful of microbial species (referred to as operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) were found in over 70% of individuals, with the rest being relatively rare.
